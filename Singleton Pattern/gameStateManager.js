// Game State Manager using Singleton Pattern

// # Step 1: Define the GameStateManager class
// This will be our Singleton class
// We create a class that will have only one instance throughout the game

/*
* Create a GameStateManager class with:
  • Private constructor to prevent direct construction calls with the `new` operator
  • Private static instance variable to hold the single instance of the class
  • Public static method getInstance() to return the single instance
  • Properties: currentLevel, playerScore, playerHealth
  • Methods: saveGame(), loadGame(), updateScore()
*/

// # Step 2: Implement the Singleton logic
// Ensure that only one instance of GameStateManager can be created

/*
* In the GameStateManager class:
  • Implement the getInstance() method:
    • Check if an instance exists
    • If not, create a new instance
    • Return the instance
  • Make the constructor private (if your language supports it, otherwise use a private creation method)
*/

// # Step 3: Add game state management methods
// These methods will manage the game state

/*
* Add the following methods to GameStateManager:
  • saveGame(): Saves the current game state
  • loadGame(): Loads a saved game state
  • updateScore(points): Updates the player's score
  • setCurrentLevel(level): Sets the current game level
  • getPlayerHealth(): Returns the current player health
*/

// # Step 4: Implement error handling and validation
// Ensure the game state remains consistent and valid

/*
* Add error checking and validation:
  • Throw an error if trying to set invalid game states (e.g., negative health)
  • Implement bounds checking for level numbers and scores
*/

// # Step 5: Create a game loop that uses the GameStateManager
// This demonstrates how the Singleton will be used in the game

/*
* Create a main game loop function that:
  • Gets the GameStateManager instance
  • Updates game state (score, level, health) as the game progresses
  • Saves and loads game state at appropriate times
*/

// # Step 6: Implement thread safety (if applicable)
// If your game is multi-threaded, ensure the Singleton is thread-safe

/*
* Consider:
  • Using double-checked locking for performance in multi-threaded environments
  • Implementing a thread-safe initialization method
*/

// # Step 7: Add logging or debugging capabilities
// This helps in tracking the usage of the Singleton throughout the game

/*
* Add a debug method to GameStateManager:
  • Log each time the instance is accessed
  • Log important state changes
*/

// # Step 8: Consider potential drawbacks and alternatives
// Understand the implications of using a Singleton

/*
* Reflect on:
  • How Singleton might affect testability of your code
  • Whether dependency injection could be a better alternative in some cases
  • How to handle potential global state issues
*/

// # Step 9: Implement a reset functionality
// Useful for restarting the game or creating a new game session

/*
* Add a reset method to GameStateManager:
  • Reset all game state variables to their initial values
  • Consider whether to create a new instance or just reset the existing one
*/

// # Step 10: Optimize for performance
// Ensure that frequently accessed state doesn't cause performance issues

/*
* Consider:
  • Caching frequently accessed state
  • Using lazy initialization for resource-heavy properties
  • Implementing a dirty flag system to track which state needs saving
*/
