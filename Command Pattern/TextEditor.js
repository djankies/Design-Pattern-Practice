// Text Editor with Undo/Redo using Command Pattern

// # Step 1: Define the Command interface
// This is the core of our Command Pattern
// Comment: We start with a common interface for all text editing commands

/*
* Create a Command interface with:
  • Methods:
    • execute(): Executes the command
    • undo(): Reverses the command
*/

// # Step 2: Create the TextEditor class
// This will be our receiver in the Command Pattern
// Comment: This class represents the text editor and its basic operations

/*
* Create a TextEditor class with:
  • Properties:
    • content: Stores the current text content
  • Methods:
    • insertText(position, text): Inserts text at a given position
    • deleteText(start, end): Deletes text between start and end positions
    • getText(): Returns the current content
*/

// # Step 3: Create concrete Command classes
// These will be our specific commands for different text editing operations
// Comment: We create specific commands that implement the Command interface

/*
* Create an InsertTextCommand class implementing Command:
  • Constructor takes TextEditor, position, and text to insert
  • Implement execute() to insert the text
  • Implement undo() to remove the inserted text
*/

/*
* Create a DeleteTextCommand class implementing Command:
  • Constructor takes TextEditor, start position, and end position
  • Implement execute() to delete the text
  • Implement undo() to reinsert the deleted text
*/

// # Step 4: Create the CommandManager class
// This will be our invoker in the Command Pattern
// Comment: This class manages command execution and undo/redo functionality

/*
* Create a CommandManager class with:
  • Properties:
    • undoStack: Stack to store executed commands
    • redoStack: Stack to store undone commands
  • Methods:
    • execute(command): Executes a command and adds it to the undoStack
    • undo(): Undoes the last command and moves it to the redoStack
    • redo(): Redoes the last undone command and moves it back to the undoStack
*/

// # Step 5: Implement a composite command for multiple operations
// Comment: Allow executing multiple commands as a single operation

/*
* Create a CompositeCommand class implementing Command:
  • Constructor takes an array of Command objects
  • Implement execute() to execute all commands in sequence
  • Implement undo() to undo all commands in reverse order
*/

// # Step 6: Create a client code to use the text editor
// Comment: Demonstrate how to use the Command Pattern in the text editor

/*
* Create a main function that:
  • Instantiates a TextEditor and CommandManager
  • Performs various text editing operations using commands
  • Demonstrates undo and redo functionality
  • Shows using a CompositeCommand for complex operations
*/

// # Step 7: Implement a command for replacing text
// Comment: Add a more complex command that combines insert and delete operations

/*
* Create a ReplaceTextCommand class implementing Command:
  • Constructor takes TextEditor, start position, end position, and new text
  • Implement execute() to replace text between start and end with new text
  • Implement undo() to restore the original text
*/

// # Step 8: Add a command history feature
// Comment: Allow viewing the history of executed commands

/*
* Update CommandManager class:
  • Add a method to get command history
  • Implement a feature to show a summary of all executed commands
*/

// # Step 9: Implement command serialization
// Comment: Allow saving and loading the command history

/*
* Create methods in CommandManager:
  • serializeCommands(): Converts command history to a serializable format
  • deserializeCommands(data): Recreates commands from serialized data
* Implement toJSON() method in each Command class for serialization
*/

// # Step 10: Add error handling and validation
// Comment: Ensure robustness in command execution and undo/redo operations

/*
* Update CommandManager and Command classes:
  • Add input validation in command constructors
  • Implement error handling in execute() and undo() methods
  • Add checks in CommandManager to handle empty undo/redo stacks
*/

// # Step 11: Implement a simple GUI (optional)
// Comment: Create a basic interface to interact with the text editor

/*
* If using a GUI library:
  • Create a simple text area for content
  • Add buttons for undo, redo, and common text operations
  • Display command history in a separate panel
*/

// # Step 12: Write unit tests
// Comment: Ensure the Text Editor functions correctly

/*
* Write unit tests to verify:
  • Correct execution of individual commands (insert, delete, replace)
  • Proper functioning of undo and redo
  • Correct execution of composite commands
  • Command history tracking
  • Serialization and deserialization of commands
  • Error handling and edge cases
